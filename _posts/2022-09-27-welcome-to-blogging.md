My first blog in almost 10 years, welcome Me!

I remember the thrill I had when I posted my first blog in 2006. It was a such journey! Since then my blogging habit was on and off for different reasons. What I can tell is that this time it feels much better. I'm much happy, much content, much experienced, and more techy than ever. Every time I come back to blogging, usually there's a post like this comes along with a prologue, often a tragic quote or verse from a poem, that mirrors what I feel at the time. Everyone knows that prologues are boring, but this time it's..

## The unexamined life is not worth living

I'll try to keep blogging, it helps clear up my thinking. i.e. it makes my thinking more concrete. If what I'm writing about contains some codes, then it will go as a github repo with a README. Otherwise it will be listed here. I'm thinking also to get back to photography and making videos. Probably they would go on one of those platforms. Let's see. 

Salam,
